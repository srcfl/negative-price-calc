# Refined Messaging for Negative Price Calculator

## Overview
The messaging has been refined to be more professional, educational, and technically accurate while maintaining emotional impact. The focus shifts from "corky" sales language to authoritative market analysis.

## Key Messaging Changes

### 1. Timing Loss Explanation (Timing-förlust)

**Previous**: "Din produktion sker vid tidpunkter med lägre priser än genomsnittet. Du förlorar pengar på dålig timing."

**New**: "Marknadstiming: X% avvikelse"
- Explains that negative timing means receiving X% lower revenues than market average
- Clarifies this is due to production coinciding with grid overproduction periods
- Positions it as a structural market problem, not personal failure

### 2. 60 Öre Subsidy Context

**New messaging includes**:
- "Den nuvarande skattereduktionen på 60 öre/kWh upphör vid årsskiftet 2025/2026"
- Explains that without this support, negative prices become even more costly
- Links to upcoming power tariffs (effekttariffer) that will further penalize poorly-timed exports

### 3. Grid and Market Impact

**Previous focus**: Individual financial loss

**New focus**: System-wide implications
- "Din export bidrog då till systeminstabilitet"
- "Intelligent exportstyrning bidrar till elnätets stabilitet"
- Explains that exporting during oversupply worsens grid imbalance and drives further price drops
- Positions smart control as beneficial for both owner AND grid stability

## Tone Refinements

### From "Corky" to Professional

**Changed terminology**:
- "Timmar arbetade gratis" → "Timmar utan ersättning"
- "Produktion bortkastad" → "Andel olönsam produktion"
- "Din investering förlorar pengar" → "Marknadsvillkoren försämrar din avkastning"
- "Stoppa förlusterna idag" → "Optimera din anläggning"

### Educational Approach

**New explanatory sections**:
1. **Systemöverskott under produktion**: Explains the technical reason for negative prices
2. **Marknadstiming**: Provides market context for production timing
3. **Nätnytta och ekonomisk optimering**: Links individual benefit to grid stability
4. **Framtidsutsikt och regeländringar**: Warns about subsidy changes and future tariffs

## AI Explainer Updates

The AI prompt has been restructured to generate:
- Professional market analysis rather than emotional appeals
- Technical explanations of grid dynamics
- Quantified impacts with proper context
- Educational content about market mechanisms

**Key prompt changes**:
- Emphasizes "saklig, professionell och utbildande utan säljtryck" (factual, professional, and educational without sales pressure)
- Includes context about 60-öringen expiration
- Focuses on system stability alongside economic impact
- Uses technical market terminology

## Implementation Benefits

### For Homeowners
- Better understanding of WHY negative prices occur
- Awareness of upcoming regulatory changes
- Clear connection between their actions and grid stability
- Professional analysis builds trust

### For Grid Operators
- Messaging aligns with grid stability goals
- Educates prosumers about system impact
- Promotes responsible export behavior
- Supports transition to smarter grid management

### For Market Efficiency
- Explains market dynamics clearly
- Shows how individual actions affect prices
- Promotes efficient resource allocation
- Prepares users for future market conditions

## Technical Accuracy Improvements

1. **Timing Loss**: Now correctly explained as systematic deviation from optimal export times, not random "bad luck"

2. **Production Impact**: Clearly differentiates between:
   - Total production (annual)
   - Production during negative prices (problem periods)
   - Percentage of production affected

3. **Market Context**: Includes structural factors:
   - Increasing renewable penetration
   - Grid balancing challenges
   - Regulatory changes
   - Future tariff structures

## Recommended Follow-ups

1. **Add specific dates** for subsidy expiration based on user's installation date
2. **Include regional variations** in negative price frequency
3. **Provide comparison** with battery storage ROI
4. **Add educational links** to grid operator resources
5. **Create glossary** of technical terms for user reference

## Summary

The refined messaging transforms the calculator from a "sales tool" into an educational platform that:
- Builds user understanding of energy markets
- Promotes grid-conscious behavior
- Prepares users for regulatory changes
- Maintains urgency through factual analysis rather than emotional appeals

This approach positions the solution as a necessary adaptation to evolving market conditions rather than a panic response to losses.
